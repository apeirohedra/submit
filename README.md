Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## How the files mean

:one: `code_book.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. <br>
:two: `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. <br>
:three: `averages_data.txt` is an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
